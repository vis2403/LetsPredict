# LetsPredict
### To develop a machine learning model to predict the income levels of an individual who earns more than $50,000 per year based on factors such as age, education, occupation, and hours worked per week (demographic factors) .

## Objective:
  - Build a strong meta model using StackingClassifier by combining all the weak learners. The final prediction accuracy and F1-score is improved for the meta model making it a better classifier.

## Methodology
  - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  - Exploratory data analysis
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training and validation
